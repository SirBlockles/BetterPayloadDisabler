# TF2: Better Payload Disabler
### Version 1.0

designed for hightower. disables the carts being pushed while retaining their dispenser properties. but most importantly, it accomplishes this _without_ freezing your server when a player stands on top of the cart.

made after getting tempbanned from UGC hightower for standing on the cart and lagging the server and realizing that i could literally write a better plugin in like an hour, so here is my plugin published before my hour-long tempban has even expired.

consider this my application for programmer :3
